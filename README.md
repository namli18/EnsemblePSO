EnsemblePSO

Ensemble Artificial Intelligence Approach

How to cite:

Code files named BPSO-MLP, BPSO-CNN, BPSO-SVM, BPSO-RF and BPSO-GB are used to feature selection using the binary particle swarm (BPSO) algorithm together with individual classifiers as multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB) algorithms.

In the Ensemble-PSO code file, prediction results are obtained from these five individual classifiers with selected feature subsets. The results are combined based on weighting using the particle swarm optimization method (PSO). Thus, an ensemble structure that increases the performance of 5 five individual classifiers is proposed.

Further detail is written as comment lines in the code.
